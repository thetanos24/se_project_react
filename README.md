# WTWR (What to Wear?): The Dynamic Weather & Wardrobe App

## Project Overview

WTWR is a responsive, single-page application built with React that provides personalized clothing suggestions based on real-time local weather data. This project demonstrates core Front-End development skills, focusing on state management, API interaction, and component-based architecture.

## Key Features & Technical Skills

This project was developed to practice and showcase proficiency in the following essential software engineering areas:

- Real-Time Weather Integration: Fetches and processes external data using the OpenWeatherMap API. Utilizes JavaScript's fetch API and Promises for asynchronous operations.
- Dynamic UI Updates: Implements complex React State Management to update the UI based on temperature and time of day, ensuring the application re-renders efficiently.
- Custom Filtering Logic: Implemented custom JavaScript utility functions to categorize raw API data into usable conditions.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
