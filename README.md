# WTWR (What to Wear?): The Dynamic Weather & Wardrobe App

## Project Overview

WTWR is a responsive, single-page application built with React that provides personalized clothing suggestions based on real-time local weather data. This project demonstrates core Front-End development skills, focusing on state management, API interaction, and component-based architecture.

## Key Features & Technical Skills

This project was developed to practice and showcase proficiency in the following essential software engineering areas:

- Real-Time Weather Integration: Fetches and processes external data using the OpenWeatherMap API. Utilizes JavaScript's fetch API and Promises for asynchronous operations.
- Dynamic UI Updates: Implements complex React State Management to update the UI based on temperature and time of day, ensuring the application re-renders efficiently.
- Custom Filtering Logic: Implemented custom JavaScript utility functions to categorize raw API data into usable conditions.
